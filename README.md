# *.github* repo for the Spyderisk open project

This contains GitHub-specific metadata, especially the organisation-level README.md. Other 
worthy project hosters such as [Codeberg](https://codeberg.com) and [SourceHut](https://sr.ht)
do not use or recognise this directory. We should ensure it is mirrored in official Spyderisk
mirrors though.

The organisation-level README is mostly generic, but has hardcoded GitHub links that can't 
be avoided.
